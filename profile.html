    <p>My name is Austin Floyd, I am a <strong>Junior</strong> at the University of Northern Colorado and I am currently studying Marketing and Digital Marketing. I intially cam here to this school to play hockey, but ened up having to go down a different path and would get to focus more on my studies and education, my friends and family, and most importantly myself. I am really interested in the technical and physcial sides of marketing, desinging but also reading numbers and analyzing behaviors of consumers. My plan is to work professionally in the Marketing field at this time, but we will see where the dance of life takes me.</p>
